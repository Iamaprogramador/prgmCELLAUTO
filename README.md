# prgmCELLAUTO
A cellular automata program for the TI-84 Plus CE.
I am originally writing this in the included BASIC language, and then, over the summer, porting it to ICE, Peter Tillema's third-party language. 
Then, I will hopefully be practiced enough in C to write it for Mateoconlechuga's C compiler.
Right now, I don't really have working code, but I will work on it more vigorously if anyone starts watching it.
